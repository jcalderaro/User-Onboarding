## STEP 3 - Make a POST Request

Being able to `POST` data is a key skill of any developer, no matter your skill level.

- Craft a `POST` request using `axios` that sends your form data to the following endpoint: _https://reqres.in/api/users_
- Verify using a `console.log()` that you are receiving a successful response back

(Note: For those that are curious, we're using [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) for this assignment's API. It's a free API that allows us to simulate a `POST` request for any data that we send it. Pretty awesome!)
