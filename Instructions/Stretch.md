## Stretch Goals

The following are stretch goals that you should attempt _after_ you meet MVP for your project:

- Add basic styling to your form in your app. Make it look pretty with any styling method you choose.
- Implement a dropdown menu in your Formik form.
- Create 3 new inputs inside your Formik form of your choice along with corresponding validation and error messaging
- Add to your existing handling so that, if a user inputs their email as `waffle@syrup.com`, they receive an error message in their form that says _"That email is already taken."_
